## MaptimeCalgary

### The presentation template
This is the first slide.

You can create slides from a basic Markdown file. Reveal.js uses the number of line-breaks to determine whether you're creating a normal-slide or a vertical slide.

Take a look at the [raw source for the slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaptimeCalgary/presentation-example/gh-pages/slides.md) and the [final product](https://maptimecalgary.github.io/presentation-example). The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/MaptimeCalgary/presentation-example).



## This is a new slide
Because there were three line-breaks above this slide, it is created as a normal 'horizontal-slide'.


## This is a vertical-slide
Because there were only two line-breaks above this slide, it is created as a 'vertical-slide'. Think of it as a sub-slide.

You can reach this slide by pressing `down` from the previous slide.

Vertical-slides are good for drilling in to topics. Think of it as a details slide that, if your short on time, you can skip over by moving `right`.



## Hey, it even supports code!

``` python
from datetime import datetime

print(datetime.now())
```



## That's about it
